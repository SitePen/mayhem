# Templating

The primary way to author templates is with an [HTML-like syntax](html/README.md), but the templating system is designed be extremely plugable. Once you understand the structure and semantics of our parse trees it should be relatively easy to plug in other templating languages, or write your own, so long as your output adheres to the parse tree interface. You can even get by without a templating language at all, and just use plain old objects or JSON for your templates.
