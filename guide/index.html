						<h2 data-id="getting-started">Welcome to Mayhem</h2>

						<div class="a" id="what-is-mayhem"></div>
						<h3 data-id="what-is-mayhem">What is Mayhem?</h3>

						<p>Mayhem is a framework for developing large, complex applications with TypeScript or JavaScript. Unlike other Web libraries and frameworks that place their emphasis on performance or file size, Mayhem is designed around these three key tenets:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Predictability</strong>: As much as possible, the framework must be designed to minimise surprise. Mayhem uses as little magic as possible in order to accomplish its goals, while still being exceptionally powerful &amp; easy to use, with a minimum of rote.</li>
							<li><strong>Extensibility</strong>: It should be possible for all parts of the framework to be easily extended or replaced with newer, better components. This allows many different classes of applications to be written, including those not envisioned when the framework was originally written, using the same basic set of tools.</li>
							<li><strong>Correctness</strong>: When writing software, it’s frustrating when your tools get you stuck. Mayhem was architected from the ground up to be extremely modular, testable, and easy to understand in order to minimise the maintenance cost of using Mayhem.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>We believe that good architecture, in combination with today’s superfast JavaScript engines, offers a very high level of performance in nearly all use cases. As such, we will never compromise the clarity or maintainability of the Mayhem codebase for the sake of performance. We hope that you will see the benefit of this decision in increased productivity and less time spent troubleshooting your apps!</p>

						<h4>What is Mayhem best for?</h4>

						<p>Mayhem is a generic application development framework that can be used for developing virtually any type of client-side, server-side, or mobile application. Because of its emphasis on strict architectural patterns and conventions, it is especially well-suited for extremely large, “enterprise-level” applications that must be maintained by large teams of developers with varying skill levels.</p>

						<p>This first release of Mayhem focuses primarily on the development of form-based client-side Web applications, but we plan on rapidly expanding functionality for other types of apps. <a href="https://github.com/SitePen/mayhem/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">Pull requests are accepted!</a></p>

						<div class="a" id="system-requirements"></div>
						<h3 data-id="system-requirements">System requirements</h3>

						<p>End-users of Mayhem applications must meet the following minimum system requirements:</p>

						<table>
							<tr>
								<td>Android</td>
								<td>4.1.2+</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Chrome</td>
								<td>Latest</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Firefox</td>
								<td>Latest <abbr title="Extended Support Release">ESR</abbr> or rapid release</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Internet Explorer</td>
								<td>8+</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>iOS</td>
								<td>6.1+</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Opera</td>
								<td>Latest</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td>Safari (Mac OS)</td>
								<td>Latest</td>
							</tr>
						</table>

						<p>Developers using Mayhem must also meet the following additional requirements:</p>

						<table>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a></td>
								<td>1.3.9+</td>
								<td>for client-side package installation</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="http://nodejs.org">Node.js</a></td>
								<td>0.10.28+</td>
								<td>for builds &amp; functional testing</td>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<td><a href="http://npmjs.org">npm</a></td>
								<td>1.4.4+</td>
								<td>for Node.js package installation</td>
							</tr>
						</table>

						<div class="a" id="installation"></div>
						<h3 data-id="installation">Installation</h3>

						<p>Depending upon the platform you are planning on developing for, there are three different ways in which installation can be performed:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>For writing Node.js apps</strong>: Mayhem can be installed for use with Node.js by running <code>npm install mayhem</code>. This will install a copy of Mayhem that has been pre-compiled for Node.js using the CommonJS module format, plus ambient declarations that can be used when writing Mayhem applications for Node.js with TypeScript.</li>
							<li><strong>For writing browser &amp; mobile apps</strong>: Mayhem can be installed for browsers &amp; mobile devices by running <code>bower install mayhem</code>. This will install a copy of Mayhem that has been pre-compiled for asynchronously loaded environments using the <abbr title="Asynchronous Module Definition">AMD</abbr> module format, plus ambient declarations that can be used when writing Mayhem applications for browsers or mobile devices with TypeScript.</li>
							<li><strong>For working on Mayhem, or compiling your own modules</strong>: The original TypeScript source for Mayhem can be installed from our <a href="https://github.com/SitePen/mayhem" title="Mayhem on GitHub">GitHub repository</a> by running <code>git clone --recursive git@github.com:SitePen/mayhem.git</code>. The README file in the repository contains additional instructions on installation and usage of the development version of Mayhem.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Because Mayhem is written in TypeScript, future versions of Mayhem will also be compiled to standard EcmaScript 6 modules once that format has been finalised.</p>

						<div class="a" id="first-app"></div>
						<h3 data-id="first-app">Creating your first app</h3>

						<p>In order to simplify the creation of new applications, Mayhem comes with a command-line generator that can be used to instantly generate new applications.</p>

						<aside class="tip"><p>In the first release of Mayhem, the <span class="sc">Mayhem generator</span> generates Web applications only. Future versions will contain additional default application profiles for many other kinds of apps.</p></aside>

						<p>To get started, run the generator as follows:</p>

						<pre class="m1"><code class="bash">$ yo mayhem webapp src</code></pre>

						<p>This will create a new skeleton Web application in the <code>src</code> directory (actually, a TodoMVC app). All that needs to be done now is to open the test application in a browser:</p>

						<pre class="m1"><tt>http://localhost/path/to/src/index.html</tt></pre>

						<p>Navigating to this index page should display a fully functioning client-side TodoMVC application, ready for you to start hacking away!</p>

						<aside class="tip"><p>The <span class="sc">Mayhem generator</span> does more than just scaffold a basic app: It automatically generate new models quickly and easily; allows you to generate routing configurations for apps that don’t have direct access to the filesystem to safely auto-discover the available views; and watches for and automatically recompiles changed TypeScript and Stylus files. Just run <tt>yo mayhem</tt> to get an overview of all the available commands.</p></aside>

						<p>TODO: Continue tutorialising the basic TodoMVC app; maybe add in user authentication or something.</p>

							<figcaption>The subsystems of Mayhem</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>The architecture of Mayhem is divided up into eight primary subsystems:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>Application</strong>: The <dfn>application subsystem</dfn> is responsible for providing a mechanism for creating new applications by configuration, dynamically loading application dependencies at runtime using dependency injection, and providing a main application-wide object for each application that is currently running in the environment.</li>
							<li><strong>Data binding</strong>: The <dfn>data binding subsystem</dfn> is responsible for all functionality related to binding properties between two objects, and observing properties on objects for changes. This subsystem is essential for implementing the MVVM pattern, which will be discussed shortly.</li>
							<li><strong>Data modelling</strong>: The <dfn>data modelling subsystem</dfn> provides functionality related to business logic, data object creation, data validation, and communication with databases.</li>
							<li><strong>Foundation</strong>: The <dfn>foundation subsystem</dfn> provides core functionality for the entire Mayhem application framework, like observable proxy objects, utility functions, and other miscellaneous critical functionality.</li>
							<li><strong>Routing</strong>: The <dfn>routing subsystem</dfn> is responsible for discovering, loading, and linking together data models and sub-views in response to navigation within an application.</li>
							<li><strong>Security</strong>: The <dfn>security subsystem</dfn> is responsible for providing user authentication &amp; authorization, access control, and other security-oriented application functionality.</li>
							<li><strong>Templating</strong>: The <dfn>templating subsystem</dfn> is responsible for creating views and linking data models to the views using easy-to-write declarative templates.</li>
							<li><strong>Views</strong>: The <dfn>view subsystem</dfn> is responsible for handling all <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr> input and output.</li>
						</ul>

						<div class="a" id="typescript"></div>
						<h3 data-id="typescript">The TypeScript language</h3>

						<p>Mayhem is written in <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a> in order to take advantage of the significant maintenance benefits that come with optional strict typing and the ability to define strong interfaces. Since these features are also critical to keeping large applications maintainable over many years—especially with teams of varying disciplines and skill levels—we strongly encourage all users of Mayhem to explore using TypeScript directly when writing apps with Mayhem. However, the TypeScript compiler does generate highly-readable, well-formed JavaScript, so if you prefer to use vanilla JavaScript, go right ahead!</p>

						<aside class="tip"><p>If you’re unfamiliar with TypeScript but want to learn how to use it, check out SitePen’s <a href="http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2013/12/31/definitive-guide-to-typescript/">Definitive Guide to TypeScript</a>. Remember that TypeScript is a full superset of JavaScript, so you can always write JavaScript and migrate to TypeScript over time—or vice-versa!</p></aside>

						<p>Mayhem uses certain conventions to provide support for Proxy-like objects in pre-EcmaScript 6 environments, which are key to providing easy-to-use view-models. In order to work around limitations within the first version of TypeScript, … TODO (talking about Callers/Events/Getters/Setters interfaces here)</p>

						<figure>
							<pre><code class="typescript">import Observable = require('mayhem/Observable');

class User extends Observable {
	get:User.Getters;
	set:User.Setters;
}

module User {
	export interface Getters extends Observable.Getters {
		(key:'username'):string;
		(key:'password'):string;
	}

	export interface Setters extends Observable.Setters {
		(key:'username', value:string):void;
		(key:'password', value:string):void;
	}
}

export = User;</code></pre>

						</figure>

						<aside class="tip"><p>The <span class="sc">Mayhem generator</span> can create these more verbose data interfaces for you automatically. As the TypeScript language continues to mature, improved code generation and annotations will be used in order to eliminate the need to write longhand interface definitions. (One useful side-benefit of having to define getters and setters separately is that it becomes possible to type properties as being read-only or write-only within the compiler.)</p></aside>

						<div class="a" id="mvvm"></div>
						<h3 data-id="mvvm">The MVVM pattern</h3>

						<figure>
							<img src="http://placepuppy.it/600/320">
							<figcaption>An overview of the MVVM pattern</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>Mayhem implements the model–view–view-model (<dfn><abbr title="model–view–view-model">MVVM</abbr></dfn>) architectural pattern, which separates business logic, user interface logic, and the user interface itself into three distinct layers. This pattern is similar to the Smalltalk <abbr title="model-view-controller">MVC</abbr> pattern (not to be confused with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_2">Model 2 MVC</a>, a pattern used by server-side “MVC” frameworks), but it uses an improved mode of interaction between the different layers in order to avoid the “fat controller” anti-pattern common to many MVC apps.</p>

						<h4>Model</h4>

						<p>The term <dfn>model</dfn> in the context of the MVVM pattern refers to a “business” object—an object that contains code and data that performs the actual work of the business. Models operate completely independently from any user interface, so can be fully reused across many different systems. For example, if you were writing software for managing a bank, <em>bank accounts</em> and <em>transactions</em> would be two different types of <em>models</em>. Models within Mayhem are normally created by subclassing the <a href="#TODO"><code>mayhem/data/Model</code></a> class, which provides standard functionality for defining, loading, validating, and saving data.</p>

						<h4>View</h4>

						<p>The term <dfn>view</dfn> in the context of the MVVM pattern refers to an object representing part of the interactive user interface of an application. Views encapsulate both input and output: they display data to the user in the form of widgets and sub-views, and collect and dispatch user input (mouse, touch, pen, keyboard, Kinect, etc.) from the user interface to the rest of the system.</p>

						<h4>View-model</h4>

						<p>The term <dfn>view-model</dfn> refers to a Model object that exposes properties that are required by a specific view. For example, if you had a <em>transaction history view</em> in your application, you would create an associated view-model that exposed a <a href="TODO">Collection</a> of <code>Transaction</code> objects to display in the list, plus additional properties that could be updated by the view in order to dynamically change the contents of the <code>Transactions</code> collection.</p>

						<p>One of the key differences between an MVVM view-model and an MVC controller is that the view-model is never given a reference to its associated view. Instead, properties are [TODO: should talk about data binding before getting here?] data-bound between the view and the view-model, so that when something in the view changes, a bound property of the view-model is updated, and vice-versa. This approach allows view-models to be decoupled from and reused by multiple different views, and also allows their logic to be tested completely independently from any user interface. It also has the added benefit of preventing any UI-specific code from ending up outside of the view subsystem.</p>

						<p>In many cases, view-models are simple proxies back to real data models. For example, while a Transaction model may store the amount of a transaction in USD cents, your view may want to display the transaction amount in its equivalent in euros, with the correct currency symbol and locale-specific number formatting. Since all other information—like the transaction ID and recipient—can be taken as-is from the original data model, there is no reason to create an entirely separate view-model that re-exposes these properties just to add this one extra piece for the view. <a href="TODO"><code>mayhem/data/ProxyModel</code>s</a> allow you to wrap an existing model object with extra properties for display in a view, with all other properties delegating back to the original data model.</p>

						<div class="a" id="conventions"></div>
						<h3 data-id="conventions">Conventions</h3>

						<h4>Application components</h4>

						<p>Mayhem Application classes include a default set of application components that are required to run an application of a given type. These components can be overridden with custom implementations, but various parts of framework code expect these essential components to exist at specific keys on the main Application object:</p>

						<ul>
							<li><code><strong>binder</strong></code>: An implementation of the <code>mayhem/binding/interfaces.IBinder</code> interface. Provides data binding.</li>
							<li><code><strong>router</strong></code>: An implementation of the <code>mayhem/routing/interfaces.IRouter</code> interface. Provides navigation and on-demand component loading for applications with discrete navigation points.</li>
							<li><code><strong>scheduler</strong></code>: An implementation of the <code>mayhem/interfaces.IScheduler</code> interface. Provides next-turn event scheduling and debouncing.</li>
							<li><code><strong>ui</strong></code>: An implementation of the <code>mayhem/ui/Master</code> interface. Provides user interface support for applications that interact directly with users through a terminal or window server.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Module paths</h4>

						<p>Mayhem assumes that a Mayhem application will use a default set of module ID paths. Each of them can be customised if needed.</p>

						<ul>
							<li><code><strong>app/models</strong></code>: This directory holds all application data models. It can be customised via <a href="TODO"><code>Application#modelPath</code></a>.</li>
							<li><code><strong>app/viewModels</strong></code>: This directory holds all application view models. It can be customised via <a href="TODO"><code>Application#viewModelPath</code></a>.</li>
							<li><code><strong>app/views</strong></code>: This directory holds all application views and templates. It can be customised via <a href="TODO"><code>Application#viewPath</code></a> and <a href="TODO"><code>Application#templatePath</code></a>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The physical location of the <code>app</code> package on the filesystem can be modified by setting [TODO: Need some Dojo configuration stuff] <code>dojoConfig.packages = [ { name: 'app', location: 'path/to/app' } ];</code> in your application’s <code>index.html</code> file.

						<h4>Routes</h4>

						<p>The default router in Mayhem will automatically generate missing keys for a route based on the route ID of a route. These keys will be generated as follows: TODO these defaults suck and will change</p>

						<ul>
							<li><code><strong>path</strong></code>: The same as the route ID.</li>
							<li><code><strong>model</strong></code>: The <code>Application#modelPath</code>, joined with the route ID, with the first letter of the last segment of the route ID capitalised. For example, given a route ID <code>transactions/account</code>, the model would become <code>app/models/transactions/Account</code>.</li>
							<li><code><strong>viewModel</strong></code>: The <code>Application#viewModelPath</code>, joined with the route ID, with the first letter of the last segment of the route ID capitalised. For example, given a route ID <code>transactions/account</code>, the view-model would become <code>app/viewModels/transactions/Account</code>.</li>
							<li><code><strong>view</strong></code>: The <code>Application#templatePath</code>, joined with the route ID, with the first letter of the last segment of the route ID capitalised. For example, given a route ID <code>transactions/account</code>, the view would become <code>mayhem/templating/html!transactions/Account.html</code>.</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Code conventions</h4>

						<p>Mayhem follows most normal TypeScript code conventions, although spaces are not placed before type definitions in order to provide better disambiguation between a type value (no space) and an object literal value (space). All modules within Mayhem are defined as external modules.</p>
					</article>

					<article>
						<p>Views can be created pro [TODO: Currently Widget in the code] the <a href="TODO"><code>mayhem/ui/View</code></a> class and constructed programmatically, or they can be generated declaratively by using a templating engine.</p>
