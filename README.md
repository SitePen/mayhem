# Prototype 2 - User Registration

## Setup

* Install `bower` and `grunt-cli` globally, `npm install -g bower grunt-cli`
* Setup development dependencies, `npm install`
* Compile TypeScript with `grunt build`

NOTE: until bower can install a built version of mayhem, you have to navigate to
third-party/mayhem and follow the setup instructions one time.
