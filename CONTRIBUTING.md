Contribution guidelines
=======================

## Hi!

* The issues tab is for **bugs and feature enhancement requests only**, not questions. If you aren’t sure if your
  problem is a bug (or you know that it isn’t), please ask in one of the
  [support forums](https://sitepen.github.io/mayhem/guide/#getting-help) instead. Any help questions posted to the bug
  tracker will normally be closed without a good answer in order to keep the bug tracker focused only on the development
  process. Sorry for any inconvenience!

## Want to submit a new feature or bug fix?

* Thank you for your contribution!
* If you want to help, but aren’t sure where to start, come [talk to us on IRC](irc://irc.freenode.net/mayhem) or ask
  how to start on a ticket that interests you
* You should also talk to us if you are working on a big thing so we can coordinate before you spend a lot of time on it
  :)
* Please make sure you sign a [Dojo Foundation CLA](http://dojofoundation.org/about/claForm) or we cannot accept your
  code
* Code should conform to our [code style guidelines](https://github.com/SitePen/mayhem/#conventions)
* If possible and appropriate, updated tests should be a part of your pull request
* If you would like to contribute improvements to the [Mayhem user guide](https://sitepen.github.io/mayhem/guide/), this is found in the gh-pages branch of the Mayhem repository

## Committers!

* Please make sure to provide rigorous code review on new contributions
* When in doubt, ask for a second review; don’t commit code that smells wrong just because it exists
* Squash all pull requests into a single commit by using `git rebase -i` after a merge. Don’t use the shiny green
  button!
* Put `[ci skip]` at the end of commit messages for commits that do not modify any code (readme changes, etc.)
